# sprint1homework
First homework assignment for Northwestern Bootcamp

Name
Sprint 1 Homework: Cleaning up HTML an CSS code to make it more accessible and clean.

Description
Starting from a provided document, I was instructed to change the HTML and CSS code to add accessibility features and leave it more efficient than when I entered.  I accomplished this by changing the <div> sections to be more specific, changed the class of the text elements to reduce CSS clutter, and added accessiblity features by allowing each element to be tabbed to using a keyboard.  I also ensured contrast was maintained, and added alt tags to images in case of low bandwith.
